Project Title: Configurable Electronic Password Lock
This project involves designing a configurable electronic password 
lock that uses a state machine to control password entry, verification, 
and locking mechanisms. The lock supports password modification 
and ensures security by locking after a specified number of incorrect attempts.

Technial:
The password lock system uses a 6-bit dip switch for password input, with a mode switch for toggling between "set" and "unlock" modes. 
Users can verify or modify passwords using confirmation and reset buttons. A state machine manages the lock's operational states, 
including input validation, password modification, and lock states.
Core components include:
(1) State Machine: Manages system states (idle, unlock, modify, locked, error).
(2) Password Register: Stores the current password and updates during modification.
(3) Comparator: Validates the input password against the stored password.
(4) Counter: Tracks incorrect password attempts and triggers a lock state when limits are exceeded.

I/Os:
Inputs:
1. 6-bit Dip Switch: Input for password
2. Mode Switch (1-bit): Toggles between "Set Password" and "Unlock" modes.
3. Confirm Button (1-bit): Confirms the input password or new password during modification.
4. Clear Button (1-bit): Resets input or clears password attempt.
Outputs:
Unlock LED: Indicates successful unlock.
Error LED: Indicates incorrect password attempt.
Lock LED: Indicates the system is locked due to exceeding maximum attempts.

Hardware Peripherals:
Three LEDS
